This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

create an account on [https://uploadthing.com/dashboard](https://uploadthing.com/dashboard)

You will use github to and after it will ask you to create a project, then go ahead and create it.

copy your uploadthingthing secret into .env file

```
UPLOADTHING_SECRET=your secret
```

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
